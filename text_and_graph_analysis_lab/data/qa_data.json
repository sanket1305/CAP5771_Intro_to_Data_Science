  "why doesn't an optical mouse work on a glass table? or even on some surfaces? Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse.  The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.  \\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion.  Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly.",

  "What is Trans Fat? How to reduce that? I heard that tras fat is bad for the body.  Why is that? Where can we find it in our daily food? Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises \"bad\" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. \\nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods.",

  "Why do people blush when they are embarrassed? Why do people blush when they are embarrassed? from ask yahoo...\\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our \"fight or flight\" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. <br />\\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. As a result of the \"fight or flight\" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. \\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. \\nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness.>>",

  "How the human species evolved? How the human species evolved? A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. Since you asked \"how the human species evolved?\" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for \"fit\" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology.",
  "Who said the statement below and what does it mean? Can someone help me with understanding someone else's wisdom, please?&#xd;<br><br>\" It is very easy in the world to live by the opinion of the world. It is very easy in solitude to be self-centered. But the finished man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. \" That is kind of a tricky little quote. Sometimes placing it in context can help. This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \"Self Reliance,\" which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). \\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them.  It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the \"independence of solitude\"). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a \"finished man\" can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced \"perfect sweetness\" comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. \\nWhat do you think?",

  "How a black hole is formed? I would like to know how a black hole can possibly be formed. Are there any experimental evidence of such creation? The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.\\nNot sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.\\nFun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in.",
  "Heavy water what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process? Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.\\nWater is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed, and to absorb heat. Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. For example unrefined uranium, which is much less expensive, can be used instead of enriched uranium.",

  "Formula1 car What makes a Formula1 car a fast car? Let me break it down-\\nEngine- 3 liter V10.  Approximately 900+ hp, 19,000 rpm.  The engine weighs about 200 lbs.  It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\\nBrakes- The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.  These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.  They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing.  The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability.  As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking.  An average person would black out in an F1 car.\\nAerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is.  These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers.  The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed.  It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.  The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.\\nTransmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions.  The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second.  All the driver does is pull a lever.  The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel. \\nWhat doesn't make the cars fast-\\nTires- The tires are grooved to limit traction.  If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash.  Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.\\nWheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology\\nBrakes- As stated earlier, size limited.  Also, no ABS at all (outlawed in 1994).",
  "how was Einstein's General Relativity theory proven ? When was it, where was it and by whom? First, I would never say that a theory has been proven. There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory, and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged, but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis, experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.\\nNow to your question (sorry for the tangent)... I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light, and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction, thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory.",

  "Capturing light in a container Can we capture light in a container? Will it run and shine forever? What kind of internal material we should use in order to do that? So the answer to your specific question is 'no'.  The problem is that if the container shines, it means that light and energy is being lost and will eventually run out.  There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\\nNow, to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam.  If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place.  Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way.  Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material.  The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in, but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics.",

  "Do animals have feelings? can an animal feel regrets , compassion, sad, fear etc? It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree), share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations.  Whether it be fear, contentment, mating urges, we have a lot of analogous mechanisms going on.  On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.\\nOne possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state.  With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals.  \\nIf the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this, and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious.  If this is so, then their feelings will be as real as human ones in all senses.",

I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation, although some schools may still only require Geometry.\\nIn the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus, but may also be taken as full \"AP\" Calculus, where the \"AP\" stands for \"Advanced Placement\" and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College).",
  "Why is there often a mirror in an elevator? What is the history behind it? The purpose is functional, but it's psychological rather than mechanical.\\n\\nHere's an explanation, from: http://www.slyasafox.com/book/book_33.html\\n\\n\"In the early industrial age, buildings began to spring up all over the east coast. Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. \\n\\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the \ufffdest problem statement tool. One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \\n\\nThen an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\\n\\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights?\\n\\nThis lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. \\n\\n\\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. \\n\\nt room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay?\\n\\nBy installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all.\" \\n\\n",

  "Why's watching Television so addictive? Whereas reading books isn't in general (no doubt there are some avid readers but  I am talking about the majority). I'd say that TV is more popular than books because it is multimedia and much more closely matches how we normally take in information. TV is video and audio. You can see and hear it and thus more information can be squeezed into a short amount of time while also giving a much richer experience. Next time you're watching TV, consider how much you would have to write just to completely describe a single frame.\\nLast, TV is also much easier because it's a passive medium.

  "How come the usage of alternate power generators is not more prevalent in a state like Californi One would expect that it would be of an interest of states to have alternate resources. California electricity is generated by several sources, including hydroelectric, wind, geothermal and nuclear (in addition to the more traditional natural gas).  The question is why these other sources aren't used more, and the answer is that historically, they've either been more expensive or have environmental risks of their own (esp. for nuclear).  As petroleum and natural gas sources start to get used up, and world demand for energy increases, the cost of electricity from natural gas will go up and the other sources will become more cost effective and more prevalent.\\nIncidentally, solar power is another source used in California, but it's provided by individuals, not power companies.  If your house has solar power and you have the right equipment, you can sell your surplus electricity to the power company and your electric meter will literally run backward.",

  "When do you use a semicolon instead of a colon?  While historically the use of the semicolon and colon were similar, modern usage seems to be diverging, with semicolons indicating breaks slightly stronger than commas and colons introducing lists and explanations. \\nSemicolons have always been used in a manner very similar to commas, but with greater \"weight.\"  That is, the semicolon introduces greater breaks in the sentence, dividing clauses which are longer and more independent, while commas are reserved for short pauses and for separating lists of short items.\\nContinuing up the continuum, colons are \"weightier\" than semicolons, but less so than periods.  They introduce a break which is longer or more important than that introduced by semicolons, but not as final as periods.  Colons separate clauses which can stand as independent sentences grammatically, while semicolons can also be used for non-sentential clauses.\\nHowever, in modern writing the colon is rarely used in this role as glorified semicolon.  The colon has developed a specific semantics as a break separating an introduction from an explanation.  For example, the colon is used after the salutation in formal letters.  It is used to introduce quotes, separating the source from the quoted text.  A colon is used to introduce a list, included bulleted lists.  A colon is used to separate the parts in a multipart title, such as \"Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books\" or \"Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't\".",

  "Why do we yawn? How is it contagious... Found an interesting article on this...\\nYawning is a unique breathing act, which is different from the usual practice of breathing. During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body, such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases, sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious. \\nThere is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn, it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a \u201ctime out\u201d to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest. \\nThis is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy.",

Danish researchers reached that conclusion analyzing the relative abundance of uranium and thorium in some rocks, and the high abundance of uranium in those suggests that there was oxygen present. Their conclusion was that microorganisms like present day cyanobacteria were converting sunlight to chemical energy through oxygen-producing photosynthesis.",

Tags are like post-it notes that readers of the content leave behind for other readers. They give clues to the context and meaning beyond a simple description. They're like finding notes in a text book scribbled by a previous owner. You can usually gain insight into the material based on those notes. \\n\\nNow imagine there is a cross-reference of all those post-its and margin notes. More than one person can add their own post-it. You can easily find the most popular \"post-its\" thanks to an index of all of them.

Next time you're together, show her MyWeb2.0 and del.icio.us in action. Show her how the information is sliced and diced-- most recent, most popular, most frequently used tags.

  "What are the effects of parental favoritism?  From my personal experience, I've seen parental favoritism cause lifetime effects. \\nMy mom's brother was the favorite- she was the least favored. 50 years later, she still struggles with feeling inadequate and has a hard time trusting people. Because of this, she has a hard time maintaining friendships and family relationships.\\nMy grandmother and her sister were treated differently by my great-grandfather. My grandmother was treated as the most special. Her sister was expected to do chores, take care of the family etc. She ended up being the dependable, reliable one because she developed her independence. She also never forgave her father or her sister for their unfair treatment. My grandmother grew up needing others to take care of her.\\nThis is a pattern I've seen. Those that are favored end up developing few of their skills and talents. Many times they grow up becoming more concerned about pleasing other people. And many times they don't know how to take care of themselves.\\nThose that are disfavored can become strongly independent, but they may also have weaknesses in their ability to trust others and form lasting relationships. What is true is that favoritism has an unhealthy emotional impact on all children, whether favored or not.\\nA good book that deals with this subject is The Emotional Incest Syndrome : What to do When a Parent's Love Rules Your Life, by Dr. Patricia Love.",

You might not have intended it, but your question is a lot more complex than you might have thought.  It turns out that the temperature of the sun is a function of how deep into the sun you are, with the surface temperature being about 6000 Kelvins.  To make things even more complicated, the Corona of the sun (which extends in all directions around the sun beyond the surface) is actually 1,000,000 Kelvins.\\n\\nThis fact is well established, but further research is required to understand *why* there is such a huge difference in temperature between the two.\\n\\nNow for the second part of your question:\\n\\nThe light intensity of the sun drops off as the inverse square of your distance from the sun.  The \"heat\" is another thing entirely, because heat is defined as the average kinetic energy of particles, and photons don't count strictly in that definition.\\n\\nThere are particles that come from the sun in the form of solar wind, and around the region of the Earth, they have a \"temperature\" around 1000k.",

  "I'm new to road biking and need a bike under $1000. What frame and parts do you recommend?  I'd agree with TaraN's answer. Take the time to really find what you want. Take a lot of extended test rides. You might find that aluminum might be too harsh for you, in which case you might find that steel or carbon might be more comfortable. That's just one example. Lots of test rides will give you a feel for how the various bikes at a given price point can handle very differently. Without getting into too much tech-speak, you might find that one bike handles a bit more twitchy than another. Think of the difference as driving a Mini Cooper versus a basic sedan. Some bikes are set up more for racing, where you'll get a quicker handling bike, whereas others will handle a bit more laid back.\\n\\nParts wise, you'll find the same component offerings on many of the manufacturers out there for a given price point, as TaraN pointed out. You'll most likely be getting a bike with Shimano componenets, with perhaps a mix of some of the manufacturer's own branded components (for example, Trek outfits their bikes with a lot of Bontrager componentry).\\n\\nFocus on the overall ride of the bike. For a $1000, you can get a lot of bike.\\n\\nWade at The Spokesman in downtown Santa Cruz is a GREAT guy - very helpful, and yes, very patient.

  "Why doesn't college football have a playoff system? Every year sportswriters and fans complain about how unfair the BCS is, so what's preventing the various conferences from a playoff system? - The bowls came first and have to be dislodged\\n\\n- The bowl organizers control larges amounts of money.  Some of these monies are given to participating universities and their conferences. Bowl organizers do not want to risk lossing this money. And universities who frequent bowls want to be assured of still receiving the big bucks before switching. Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters.\\n\\n- Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes, so they limit the number of games per year.  Playing a game takes a lot of the players time preparing and practicing.  Also due the physical nature of the game, players need several days to recovery.  This limits games to about one every 5 days or so (about one a week). A playoff system would require the two teams meeting for the championship to play and additional 2-4 games depending on the number of teams allowed to participate in the playoffs.",

There are particular models of Gibson & Gretsch that have the diagonal bridge piece that appears in the movie -- Gretsch calls it a \"chromatic tailpiece\".  I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape.\\n\\nThe one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie), it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious \"soapbar\" pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today, but I can't believe that was available then).",

She began as a basketball All-American, then won two track and field golds at the 1932 Olympics. Next she turned professional and began touring the country, exhibiting her prowess in track, swimming, tennis, baseball, and even billiards. In 1935 Zaharias took up golf and excelled at that, too, winning 82 tournaments in a 20-year career. She was only 42 when she died of cancer in 1956.\"",
  "Could a very powerful directional microphone pickup sounds from the past? In much the same way that a a radio telescope 'sees' past events, could a very powerful directional microphone pickup sounds from the past? In a sense, any microphone is picking up sounds from the past, due to the speed of sound. This is similar to what you mentioned with radio telescopes.\\n\\nThe main differences are 1) velocity -- light moves at about 1 foot per nanosecond while sound moves around 1 foot per 1/1000 second, and 2) that sound moving though a medium diffuses quite rapidly. Something really loud, like thunder, you might hear from 20-30 seconds away. For normal, everyday sounds, the delay won't be more than maybe a few tenths of a second.",

  "What was the first currency ever used?  The earliest form of currency used was large stones that could be used to get food and meat in exchange - this was during the stone age. Before this there was a barter of goods (so i am not considering it currency)\\nLarge stones which were round were considered more valuable since they were more difficult to obtain\\n\\nThe first recorded accounts of currency date back to 2000 BCE and silver or metal tokens were used to represent a stored value of grain. Also these were useful to ensure that a shipment of commodities arrived with the same goods that were shipped\\n\\nPaper money was used in the 18th century, but only in the late 18th and through the 19th century was a central monetary authority created in various states that had a virtual monopoly of creating bank-notes that had to be accepted as legal tender everywhere (Prior to this, the one accepting payments could refuse the payment if it was not in a currency which  had been predetermined before the loan or in general use: Note gold and silver were widely used as legal tender)",

  "what are the materials that can be used to produce laser beam? what are the differences between the those beams? Materials that form an inverse energy distribution?  Not quite.\\n\\nThere are three basic components for getting a laser to work.  First, one needs an excitation source (pumping source) such as a flashlamp, an electrical spark, etc.  Second, one needs a material (the gain medium) which can exhibit what's known as population inversion - the capacity for a material to raise the electron energy level from the lower to the upper energy states.  Nearly all materials will exhibit this behavior with some more efficiently than others.  Finally, one needs to direct the stimulated energy by using a resonator.\\n\\nThere are many combinations of pump sources, lasing materials and optical configurations depending on the intended use.  There are solid state (ruby, Nd:YAG), gas (nitrogen, helium-neon) and semiconductor (gallium-arsenide) lasers that come in a variety of wavelengths (colors) to choose from, again, depending on what you want to do with it.\\n\\nJust a little bit of background: My degree is in Physics, and I've been working in the lasers and electro-optics field for the past 10+ years.

  "Is there any proven evidence that Mars at some point in the past had microscopic life? what supports this theory? The answer to your question is no.  There is no absolutely definitive evidence to date.  We do have very strong evidence that significant amounts of water once existed on the Martian surface, and some recent results show that Martian water may still exist below ground, and under heavy packs of ice.    There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.  Given this, and the ability for solar system bodies to seed each other via ejecta from large impacts, Mars could very possibly have been seeded by Earth or vice versa many billions of years ago.  Still, we're not sure if life exists or every existed there.    The most recent chapter was the recent discovery of methane there.  Methane can be created by non-biological processes, but we have not observed the right conditions for this on Mars.  Another possible explanation would be a biological origin for the gas, potentially from colonies of microscopic organisms in the soil.    Given our current rate of deepening understanding, we will likely solve this mystery sometime in the next 50 years, but as of now we simply don't have enough evidence to constitute \"proof\"",

  "What is programming?  Programming is instructing a computer to do something for you with the help of a programming language. The role of a programming language can be described in two ways:\\n\\n   1. Technical: It is a means for instructing a Computer to perform Tasks\\n   2. Conceptual: It is a framework within which we organize our ideas about things and processes. \\n\\nAccording to the last statement, in programming we deal with two kind of things:\\n\\n    * data, representing ``objects'' we want to manipulate\\n    * procedures, i.e. ``descriptions'' or ``rules'' that define how to manipulate data. \\n\\nAccording to Abelson and Sussman ([ABELSON, 1985, 4,])\\n\\n    ``.....we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combinign simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\\n\\n    primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concerned\\n\\n    means of combination, by which compound expressions are built from simple ones, and\\n\\n    means of abstraction, by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units.''\\n\\nA programming lanugage should both provide means to describe primitive data and procedures and means to combine and abstract those into more complex ones.\\n\\nThe distinction between data and procedures is not that clear cut. In many programming languages, procedures can be passed as data (to be applied to ``real'' data) and sometimes processed like ``ordinary'' data. Conversely ``ordinary'' data can be turned into procedures by an evaluation mechanism.",

Frankly, the answers thus far show a complete lack of understanding of basic theodicy and even the Christian Bible.  Assuming that \u2013 as a Christian \u2013 you buy into Job\u2019s tale as at least allegorical, then there is acknowledgement that you cannot know the mind of G-d.  To attempt to do so is itself blasphemous.

I will put my hand to my mouth.\\n5 Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will go no further.\\n6 \u00b6 And Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest and said:\\n7 Now gird up your loins like a man, and I will question you; and you make Me to know.\\n8 Will you also set aside My judgment; will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?\\n9 And have you an arm like God; or can you thunder with a voice like His?\\n10 Adorn yourself with majesty now, and with grandeur, and clothe yourself with glory and honor;\\n11 pour forth the outbursts of your anger; yea, look on everyone who is proud, and bring him down low;\\n12 look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, and trample the wicked in their place;\\n13 hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness.\\n\\nKnow that to contend to know G-d is to set yourself above him.\\n\\nA previous answer blasphemed: \u201cG-d desires that we do not suffer, but as a result of the choices men made we have suffering.\u201d\\n\\nAnd also: \u201cBut there is a plan to alleviate the suffering.

  "What are the best ways to incentivise people to answer questions here? Appeal to their ego? wallets? sense of belonging? or something else? I think that, though counterintuitive, one of the most effective ways was to limit the number of questions a user can answer per day. A casual user will still answer the 11th question the next day, and more hard-core users will try to answer as many questions as allowed. For this to work, the limit has to be pretty small, at least starting out, so that it is reasonably easy for someone with other commitments to achieve it. Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn \"incentivizes\" people to answer questions. And by placing a premium on the number of questions a user can answer per unit time, the likelihood that the user will throw him/herself into it full-throttle but then quickly become bored is also decreased.\\n\\nSee my answer to the question, \"Why am I only allowed to answer 10 questions a day here?\":\\n\\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005120801767\\n\\nOn the issue of the term \"incentivize\"--it is shameless corporate-speak, but it describes an impersonal, profit-oriented process.

(a favourite scam is to charge maybe 50cents on a statement, that way you dont notice it, but a scammer who charges 10,000 card owners 50cents a month can make $5000 a month no sweat -- and you dont even realize it)\\n\\n6. also dont forget to shread any credit card solicitations you dont plan to use.",

  "Are Wireless Networks Secure?  Unfortunately, no computer network is truly secure. It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or \"snoop\" the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or \"inject\" unwelcome traffic as well. However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\\n\\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\\n\\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\\n\\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now \"secure enough\" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or \"encrypt\" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\\n\\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!",

  "What makes a teacher want to leave their profession?  It seems like a lot of factors contribute to teacher attrition (leaving the profession). But apparently new teachers are most likely to abandon ship.\\n\\nAccording to a 1986 survey, more than 2/3 of all beginning teachers will have left during their first four years of teaching and 40-50% of them will leave during the first seven years of their career. (Huling-Austin, 1986).\\n\\nThese are some factors likely most likely to affect the attrition of new teachers:\\n\\n1) Beginning teachers are unable to cope with teaching problems like discipline, difficulties with parents, and lack of sufficient or appropriate teaching materials.\\n\\n2) Beginners are often given the most difficult teaching assignments. \\n\\n3) Novice teachers often receive little or no support after leaving the university and find that their teacher education programs ill-prepared them for the realities of teaching.\\n\\nOther factors, such as salary, affect attrition rates, but perhaps the fact that beginning teachers lack adequate support and resources to handle such a large responsibility (basically parenting your students) is where the responsbility lies.",
  "How do I tone my butt? What's the best exercise for butts?  Where do you live?  I have been taking a class called \"Core Fusion\" for almost a year now, and it has been the most effective thing I've done in terms of toning my body up (all over, not just butt).  It is offered at Exhale Spa, which has locations in Boston, New York, Chicago, Venice (CA) and Santa Monica - and I believe they'll be opening up a Dallas location in 2006.  \\n\\nIf you are not near an Exhale, yoga has a lot of postures that will help you tone your butt muscles (maybe check out a local gym or studio?).  So does Pilates (which I'm not really a fan of - I find it boring).  \\n\\nThere are also the old \"standbys\" of squats and lunges (you can get added benefit by integrating props or machines - i.e. do the lunges or squats on the Smith Machine - the one that has the bar with adjustable weights that you square on the back of your shoulders while doing the exercises, or stand with your back to the wall, place a physioball behind you and roll it up and down the wall with your back as you squat).  One important thing to remember about squats and lunges is not to let your knees go forward of your ankles - that puts a lot of strain on your knees and sets you up for unpleasant injuries.  \\n\\nIf you go to the gym, some of the weight machines they should have can be effective butt toners - like the leg/hamstring curl machines.",

  "Which part-time MBA program will add value to a software developer with 15 years experience?  Wow.  There are some pretty negative answers in this thread.\\n\\nPick a good program.  Pick a highly rated program.  The brand *is* part of the value of an MBA, and frankly, the lower rated programs aren't that much cheaper.  Here in the Bay Area, Haas (Berkeley) has a great ranking (top 5 in part time rankings, recently been in the top 10 for full time).  I am currently a student at Haas (in the PT program), and I can't understand why people would pick a different program in this region.  Stanford, unfortunately, doesn't have a part time program.\\n\\nI agree with the previous poster who said you need to have an idea what you want out of it.  Go in with a plan on how you're going to get value from the MBA, and just from being a student.  I'm amazed at the access I get just by being an MBA student.  It opens a lot of doors.  But you need to be very goal directed to get this value.\\n\\nI can't agree with the person who said networking in a PT program isn't good.  As a current PT student, I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies, right now.  Comparing notes with some co-workers who are recent graduates from the FT programs at Wharton, Stanford, Columbia, it's clear that my network is broader, more active, and more useful right now than their networks.\\n\\nSo - to your actual question.  If you are in the Bay Area, pick Berkeley (I'm biased, obviously).  Really, you can gain a lot of value from any part time MBA program.  But talk to people, figure out how *you* can gain value from an MBA, and then go from there.",
  "Are humans still evolving? Seems the vast majority of humans live long enough to procreate.  Is natural selection dead (or sleepy)?  If not, what are the attributes that are being selected for/against in humans these days? Evolution is ever-present as always. You could argue it's rate is a function of environment change. So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation. Extreme evolution happens when an organism's environment changes and it cannot escape it. As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead. Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet, if it doesn't kill the species completely, will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event.\\n\\nGiven that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it?\\n\\nIs average height an example of this? It would certainly seem that humans are growing taller on average, and what western (cultural bias) woman does not want a tall mate for example. It should be noted however that who we think is desirable for sex is very culturally dependent and may not lead to the best long-term (breeding) prospects for an individual conceived to those parents.",

  "How do you negotiate a job offer?  At the point you have a job offer, you are in the best position to negotiate.  This is because they have already spent the money to get all the way through the recruiting process, and if they were to start again from scratch it might cost them an additional 20-50k to bring a different candidate into the position.  Add to this the cost to the project of having an unfilled position for a longer period than expected, and you'll find there is a pretty large margin for you to negotiate where their net costs will be lower if they acquiese to your requests.\\n\\nThe other factor is the overall job market.  In today's market, where employment is picking up in many sectors you're in a good spot to negotiate.\\n\\nNow the right place to phrase things is to describe competitive offers (hopefully you'll have some) in terms of their relative advantage.  If one of your alternative offers pays more, you can allude to this vaguely.  Even if they do not, you can allude to the relative advantages (the types of challenge, the convience of the commute etc).  This will create a more competitive landscape where your potential employer feels like they need to overcome other offers (and not that you are simply greedy and would like more cash).\\n\\nUnless the potential employer has really lowballed you (i.e. you are well below industry averages for your area), you should shoot for a modest counter-proposal of 5-15%.  Put this out there with clear timelines for when they need to respond, and other forms you might accept (signing bonus, trading-up level/rank, etc).\\n\\nYou should stay professional throughout the process, even if your offer is rejected.  Employers know that this is the right time to bring these things up, so don't worry about burning bridges by putting a request out there at this stage.\\n\\nOk.  Hope that helps!",

  "What is Visual Basic?  Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\\n\\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\\n\\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel.",

In the north, boys are on average 50 mm taller and girls 20 mm taller. The populations are relatively stable, and Frisians are genetically more Scandinavian, whereas Limburgers have southern European roots. However, although boys in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant groups are about 95 mm shorter than ethnic Dutch, they are taller than in their countries of origin. Researchers point to the increase over the past 30 years in the amount of protein in the diets of the Dutch, the world's highest consumers of dairy products. \\n\\nMiranda Fredriks, one of the researchers in the recent study, emphasised other health and hygiene factors as well as diet--for example, the Netherlands has a 95% vaccination rate among children.\\n\\nLastly it's the healthcare system and wealth, every dutch person has access to the healthcare system and overall the dutch are fairly well off to being with. It's been shown that wealth has a direct impact on height..",

  "Can animals really predict earthquakes?  There was a PBS program 'Nature', just aired a couple of weeks ago, about whether animals can predict nature disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Whether animals can predict earthquakes is not conclusive. But there's a scientist in Berkeley (forgot his name) claimed he had predicted earthquakes accurately in the last few decades. What he used was simply newspaper ads on missing pets. He said normally you'd see about 10-15 missing pets ads, but before earthquakes, the missing pets ads would increase. His theory is contraversial, but it's worth a try. You may want to test that theory. \\n\\nThe program also mentioned about the terrible tsunami in Asia over a year ago. It mentioned none of the animals got harmed since they 'knew' the waves were coming and escaped from the disaster. \\n\\nOne theory is that animals can hear low frequency sound from beneath the earth, like grinding sound of moving rocks. \\n\\nAnyway, you'll find some interesting programs on PBS stations.",

  "Can someone *simply* explain what a stock \"short\" is?  Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this:\\n\\nWhen you think a stock is going to go down...\\n1. You borrow shares of stock you don't own, typically from your broker.\\n2. You sell those shares at today's price.\\n3. You wait for the stock to go down.\\n4. You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price.\\n5. You return the borrowed shares.\\n6. You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price.\\nSteps 1 & 5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker.\\n\\nThe advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down.  (With a normal stock purchases, you only make money if the stock goes up.)\\n\\nThe disadvantage is that in theory, you could lose an unlimited amount of money.  For example, if the stock goes up to five times its original value, you've just lost four times your investment.  (With a regular stock purchase, the most you can lose is the amount you originally invested.)",
  "Is there a cure for malaria?  There are several means of successfully treating malaria if contracted, yet malaria is still one of the leading causes of preventable death in the developing world.

  "What are the odds of life on another planet?  Answers to this question can vary greatly, but a good framework to think about it is the Drake Equation.  Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets.  As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\\n\\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\\n\\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high.  The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming.  Even in stranger systems that feature planets several times Jupiter's mass, it is possible that a terrestrial satellite of such a large planet could harbor the right conditions for life.\\n\\nIt's a fun thing to work through the Drake equation yourself.  Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\\n\\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\\n\\nN = 10 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0.33 \u00d7 1\u00d710-7 \u00d7 0.01 \u00d7 67 = 2.211\u00d710-7 = 0.0000002211\\n\\nwhere N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year.  \\n\\nTo get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms:\\n\\n10 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0.33 = 3.3\\n\\nSo about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year.",
  "What is your opinion on online dating?  It works.  I met my bf of almost 3 years through online dating.  That doesn't mean I didn't meet alot of incompatible people.  I used online dating on and off for about a year before I met him.  \\n\\nOnline dating is just another way to meet people, but it shouldn't be the only way you meet people.  If you're banking on it working, it probably won't because you've invested too much emotionally and your expectations will colour your experience.  It works when you stop hoping each person you meet will be the one and instead, decide to just have fun with the experience, regardless of the outcome.  Yes, even a bad date can be fun.  Think of the anecdotes you can share with your friends.\\n\\nI find it takes a few weeks to get a feel for how things work.  Then, it's up and down for awhile depending on who you come into contact with.  When it doesn't feel fun anymore, TAKE A BREAK.  Come back in a few months.  Change your profile to reflect how you're feeling.  \\n\\nIt's important that you feel good about yourself or you won't attract the people you want because who wants to be with someone who's down on themselves?  Online dating is really a reflection of how you're  feeling.  When you feel good about yourself, your online experience improves.  When you feel bad, it tends to be a not so good experience.  \\n\\nI was about to pull my dating profile because I found I was meeting lots of people through offline methods.

What could be the problem? Few things to look for:\\n\\n1. Do you have cable or dsl or dial connection?\\n2. Earlier when you did not have the router, were you entering the login/password to connect to internet? If so, you have to configure your cable/dsl modem to host the login/password.

Did you connect the ethernet cable from the cable/dsl modem to the \\n    WAN port of the router?\\n4. Are you getting the Dynamic IP assigned by the router? Check it by Start->Run->Cmd->ipconfig.

  "How can we improve the quality of the teachers in high schools?  hi,\\n\\nThis question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. \\n\\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\\n\\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\\n\\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. it's not suprising. they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\\n\\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.\\n\\n4) accountability- it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. it's not. the other factors are equally important, if not more so. to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff.\\n\\n5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important.\\n\\nhope this helps?",
  "what was Hitchcock best movie? in which movie he had introduced more new techniques the any of his movies? Generally, film geeks tend to come down in favor of Vertigo or Notorious, but the previously mentioned North By Northwest gets a lot of votes, too.\\n\\nNotorious is usually cited by European critics because of the amazing work by both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, plus it is the film that introduced the concept of the McGuffin. Essentially, this is the plot device that everything seems to be hinging upon while the story is doing something else (much sneakier) in the background. In Notorious, the McGuffin is (are) the wine bottles full of uranium.\\n\\nI tend to think that Vertigo is his best because it's just so damn unbelievable and over-the-top but he still pulls it off. Jimmy Stewart was never better in his whole career and the cinematography, music and mood is just amazing.\\n\\nOther (not yet mentioned) great Hitchcock films that you must see would be:\\n\\n1.

  "Should I rent or buy? I live in an area with very high real estate prices. I can afford to buy, but I'm wondering if I should just rent and save a bunch of money. It depends on what you mean by \"save a lot of money\".  If you are trying to save money over a period of time, it depends.  Over the long haul you might save money by buying, since you'll end up owning the property and could sell it and recover your investment.  You might even make money by buying if you live in an area where the property value is likely to go up over the period of time you might live there.\\n\\nIf you're trying to save money on a monthly basis, renting is usually cheaper, unless a) you might rent out one or more rooms, thus off-setting your out-of-pocket monthly expenses, or b) you can afford to put down a large down-payment.\\n\\nLiving in a high-cost area myself, I say \"buy\" if you can afford it.

Blue photons are the most energetic of the visible light photos, and interact more with the atmosphere as a result. To be clear, all colors get scattered, it s just that blue is affected the most because of it is more energetic.   A related effect happens around sunset. At this time of day, sunlight needs to travel through significantly more air to reach your eyes. The length of air is so long that nearly all the blue and green is scattered away before it reaches you. All that is left is yellows, oranges and reds, some of which reaches your eyes, and the rest scattered in the sky within your view.",

  "Explanation for correlated wave function collapse at a distance (Quantum Mechanics)? I remember from physics class in college that two correlated wavefunctions (e.g., sum of wavefunction spins = 0) can exhibit strange behavior at a distance.  left alone (e.g., without measurement of wavefunctions), each wavefunction (called A & B) has a probability of 50% spin up and 50% spin down.  WavefunctionA (WF_A) is IN NEITHER state until it is ACTUALLY measured.  the moment WF_A it is measured, WF_B assumes the opposite spin with DEFINITE probability.  i understand that no information is transferred at a distance between WF_A and WF_B, but HOW does this happen.  WHAT is the mechanism that collapes WF_B into a definite spin state at a distance? I am not looking for explanations like \"satisfies laws of conservation\" ... instead i am looking for physical mechanism that allow this seemingly incredible phenomena to work.  If the \"weirdness\" i am describing is an artifact of the way i am asking the question (which is what i suspect), explainations there would be appreciated as well. An equally valid question would be \"what is the mechanism that causes WF_A to collapse when it is measured?\"  The schroedinger equation does not predict collapse as a result of any interaction, so it is outside the theory taught in undergraduate classes.  There is no accepted theory (or in my opinion, any reasonable theory at all) as to why measurement causes a selection of a single eigenvalue out some non-eigenstate.  The idea that measurement on one object has ramifications on another object seems more mysterious, but it's not fundamentally different than the idea that measurement causes collapse in the first place.  You won't find a satisfying answer.",

  "Why is the voltage ratinging always a multiple of 11 ? For household we have 110 V, 220 V.\\nFor high voltage lines: 11 KV, 22 KV , 33 KV etc. 110 Volts is nominal and may vary when measured by a voltmeter.  That said, power is supplied using sets of three separate parallel wires that you can see up on most power poles.  The very high voltage there is stepped down using a transformer to supply most houses and businesses with a usable lower voltage.  The voltage between any one of the three wires to ground in a house is 110 Volts for example to light a light bulb.  The voltage between any two wires is 220 Volts and is used for example to power a clothes dryer or kitchen range.  Houses do not use all three wires.  A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.  Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits.  Electrical power is conducted cross-country at very high voltages using high tension lines strung in sets of three wires or phases which produces the multiple of 11 you mention.  Incidentally there may be an additional single wire above all the rest to arrest lightning strikes.",

The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). \\n\\nI emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque. So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.\\n\\nHope this helps!",

The Controller is responsible for allocating HTTP requests to the appropriate Action handler (Model) based on configuration mappings.\\n\\nThe Model contains the business logic for the application. The Controller then forwards the request to the appropriate View component, which is usually implemented using a combination of HTML with PHP tags in the form of templates. The resulting contents are returned to the client browser, or via another protocol such as SMTP.\\n\\nphp.MVC is a PHP port of Jakarta Struts.

In political science, a \"nation\" refers to a group of people who feel bound into a single body by shared culture, values, folkways, religion and/or language.  A \"state\" just refers to a patch of land with a sovereign government.  States often coincide with nations (and are called \"nation-states,\" but not always.

From Wikipedia:    \"Legal separation is a possible step towards divorce under United States law. A couple are legally separated if they have successfully petitioned a court to recognize their separation; simply living apart does not constitute separation for these purposes. A period of legal separation constitutes grounds for divorce; the length of that period varies from state to state.    Legal separation does not automatically lead to divorce. The couple may reconcile, in which case they need do nothing in order to remain married. If they do not reconcile, and wish to divorce after the statutory time period, they must file for divorce explicitly.\"",

  "What is the difference between phishing and pharming?  Both are entirely made-up terms, of course.  \"Phishing\" generally refers to those e-mail messages that say they're from a bank (or eBay or PayPal or your ISP), but the links actually go to some other web site where the phisher (still pretending to be a bank) asks for your information, and will use it to steal your identity, money, etcetera.\\n\\n\"Pharming\" is another twist on the same thing, using more devious tricks.  In phishing mail you can usually figure out that the site you're about to visit isn't really your bank.  So for \"pharming,\" they'll first trick you into running a program (see \"trojans,\" \"malware,\" \"spyware,\" etcetera) that changes the way your computer looks up domain names.  Then, the pharmer can tell your computer that bank.com is some web server in Russia, and it's much harder to figure out that something's wrong.\\n\\nThere's some good info about these kinds of scams at http://antispam.yahoo.com/faqs#a13 .",

  "do i need to pay tax before filing tax return if i sell my ISO stock options this year?  As you may know, NQSO (non qualifying stock options) have tax withheld at source as soon as you exercise, so theoretically you don't have to pay any estimated tax on NQSO exercises/sales (although see * below).\\n\\nWith Incentive Stock Options (ISO) though, the situation is quite different.\\n\\nIt sounds like you plan to exercise and sell your ISOs on the same day.  If so, then this is what's called a \"disqualifying disposition\".  In other words, you will be liable for ordinary income tax on the spread (sale price - exercise price).  \\n\\nIn general, the IRS wants you to pay tax in the quarter in which the related income is earned.  So you theoretically should pay the estimated tax at your standard income tax rate in the same quarter you exercise and sell ISOs.  You do this by filing an Estimated Tax payment.\\n\\n\\nHowever, there is a way to postpone filing these taxes until your normal April next year tax return.     The following information is sourced from See http://www.fool.com/school/taxes/taxes35.htm. \\n\\n1.  The simplest way is just to suck it up and not worry about paying a penalty for underpayment of taxes.  Depending on how much you think you can earn on your money, and when you were supposed to pay the tax, this may be a win for you (this used to happen a lot during the dotcom/IPO days of 1999-2000).  Be wary though that you probably can't keep doing this year after year without the IRS getting on your case. \\n\\n2.  Alternatively, you can avoid the underpayment penalty *if* any of the following are true\\n\\na) you owed no tax at all in the prior tax year (and were a US citizen/resident for all of that year)\\n\\nb) you expect to owe less than $1000 in tax this year (unlikely, since you're exercising ISOs)\\n\\nc) your ordinary income tax withholding (e.g. from your wages and/or NQSO exercise) will exceed 90% of this year's tax bill.  This may happen if your ISO exercise/sale is less than around 10% of your total income for the year.\\n\\nd) your ordinary income tax withholding (from wages and/or NQSO) is greater than 100% of your last year's tax liability and your previous year's Adjusted Gross Income was < $150,000.   If your previous year's AGI was >= $150,000 (lucky you), then you need to pay at least 110% of last year's tax liability in order to avoid a tax underpayment penalty.\\n\\n\\n\\nClear?  As mud?\\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\\n\\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%).  \\n\\nIf you do, you will *still* be subject to tax this year, due to the dreaded AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax), but you can use that AMT tax liability as a credit for future years when your AMT is less than your ordinary income tax.  However, that's a topic for a whole 'nother question/answer.   \\n\\n\\n* Even with NQSOs, if the amount held at source is less than your eventual tax rate for the year,  you may be subject to tax penalties unless you meet one of the exceptions listed in a) through d) above.",

To avoid Indians, they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area. Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins. Hence, \"I'll be there with bells on.\" The peddlers' arrival was a much anticipated major event in the mostly tedious and hard lives of settlers, not only for the goods they sold, but also for the news, letters, and messages they carried from the outside world.\"",

  "What are the advantages of a compact crankset over a triple on a bicycle? I'm considering switching out my triple crankset for a compact. I tried a rental bike with a compact (Cannondale R2000, nice bike) and liked it quite a bit. Right now I'm riding a Specialized Roubaix with Shimano 105 components.\\n\\nI'm something of a beginner, having just started about three months ago. I have a climber's build and tend to like moderately hilly routes. The main advantage is that the compact crankset gearing is much closer to the high cadence riding that is the current trend in modern cycling.  With a standard triple crank you have 30/42/52 chainrings, from which most people use the 42 and 30 rings.  The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.  The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\\n\\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.  The 34 gives you short enough gearing to get up big hills but is not quite as short as the granny gear on the triple, and the 50 gives you the speed in a manageable dose.\\n\\nA couple things to consider, though.  In order to switch to a double compact, you need to replace a fair number of components, including the bottom bracket, cranks, rear derailleur (optional but highly recommended), front derailleur and possibly your left shifter.

  "What exactly is the difference between stock options and stock grants?  Stock option grants and stock grants are two forms of compensation often offered as incentives in addition to base salary offered to a newly hired employee. This practice is especially common in the high tech industry. \\n\\nStock options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell specific amount of a particular stock at a certain price within a set period of time. The set price is called the strike price. When you (the stock option holder) make use of your right to buy/sell stock according to the terms of the option, you are exercising the option. Call options are options giving you the right to buy stock. Put options are options giving you the right to sell stock. Employers grant call options to employees. Let's take an example: Let's say you are hired by Google and they offer you options to buy 100 shares of Google stock at $400 within the next 5 years. This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. Let's say it's after four years now. Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. So the stock option is basically not worth anything if currently the stock price is lower than your option strike price. But as long as your option has not expired, it's possible that the stock price could go above your strike price and make your stock options worth something.\\n\\nStock grants are simpler to understand. The employer gives you some shares of stock for free. So let's use the Google example again. Suppose Google hired you and gave you 100 shares in a stock grant. Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\\n\\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. That means that you are not given the full amount of options or stock right away, but rather the employer gives it to you over time. A common vesting schedule is vesting over four years, so that you get 1/4 of the stock or options offered after the first, second, third, and fourth year you have been at the company. This is done to give employees an incentive to stay at the company.",

I recently purchased a new DSLR camera and a new photo printer, and I'm ready to replace an older (smaller) monitor.\\n\\nHow much better are the monitors above $1000? The problem with most current LCD technology is that the chrominance isn't as good as with traditional CRT-based monitors. There are some LCD ones just coming out that have full-color backlight which should make them actually _better_ than CRTs (according to some Wired article I read, anyhow.)\\n\\nPersonally, I've been pretty happy with the Dell 24xx monitors - they're under $1k, they have a multitude of inputs, and I think I've only got one stuck pixel (and no dead ones.) You're still going to have to color-correct anyway, but you'd have to do that on _any_ monitor you get. (A good gamma correction curve will solve a multitude of ills.)",

  "how come our eyes are located in the front and not on the side of the head?  The predatory mammals (which includes us humans) -- flesh-eating hunters such as the cats the dogs, wolves and foxes; the bears; and the weasel family -- have binocular vision: eyes in the front of their heads, with powerful eye muscles that enable them to focus very rapidly and to contract or dilate the pupils according to whether the light is bright or dim. An animal that is preyed upon by many enemies has its eyes out on the sides of its head: each eye with its own field of vision. For example, a cottontail rabbit can see what is above, behind, on either side, and in front of it except what is right before its nose. He probably does not see the clover leaf he eats. Species which are hunted by other animals but which are predators themselves at times, commonly have eyes that are a compromise. A possum's eyes are located at an angle of about 30 degrees with the axis of the body.",

This term derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints, first used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry. Alpha Test was the unit, module, or component test phase; Beta Test was initial system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified. The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early samples of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated after the model had been in production a while.\"",
  "Why did the Replacements break up?  Defeated from the lackluster performance of Don't Tell a Soul, Paul Westerberg planned on recording a solo album, but Sire rejected the idea. Consequently, the next Replacements album, All Shook Down, was a solo Westerberg record in all but name. Recorded with a cast of session musicians as well as the band, All Shook Down was a stripped-down, largely acoustic affair that hinted at the turmoil within the band. Chris Mars left shortly after its fall 1990 release, claiming that Westerberg had assumed control of the band; he would launch a solo career two years later. The Replacements toured in support of All Shook Down, with Steve Foley, formerly of the Minneapolis-based Things Fall Down, as their new drummer. Neither the tour nor the album were successful, and the Replacements quietly disbanded in the summer of 1991.",

I would love to do something special for him, but we are a little limited on funds. What can I do to make this night special? \\n\\nI would love to hear some ideas from some of you! \\nThank you in advance! :) My favorite times with my loved one is when we actually have time to sit and reflect about what the other one means to us. Going out to eat is traditionally what is done on an anniversary, but I prefer one on one time where there is nobody else around. No strangers talking loudly, no waiters to interrupt, no time wasted in line or in the car.  \\n\\nIn my opinion, Anniversaries are about each other, and to do that, you've gotta block out the rest of the world.  Here's my recipe for a fabulous anniversary. FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET SOME PAPER, PENS, AND AN ENVELOPE. I'll tell you why in a little bit.\\n\\nNext, plan the environment - Stay home (or rent a hotel if you want to get away from the day-to-day). Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles.  Put your favorite (but easy to prepare) foods around you - cheeses, pizza, strawberries, chocolate, wine, etc.\\n\\nNow here comes the important part - sit directly in front of each other on the floor. Knee to knee, and eye to eye. Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. Before you know it, hours will have passed. Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. \\n\\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. How they make you feel, and why you love them. Why you appreciate them. The more specific you get the better. For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. Now don't let the other person read it. Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. \\n\\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\\n\\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\\n\\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think?",

The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\\n\\nPopulation\\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\\n\\n\\nName\\nThe most familiar name, Cherokee, comes from a Creek word \"Chelokee\" meaning \"people of a different speech.\" In their own language the Cherokee originally called themselves the Aniyunwiya (or Anniyaya) \"principal people\" or the Keetoowah (or Anikituaghi, Anikituhwagi) \"people of Kituhwa.\" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Ca\u00e1xi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohu\u00e1 (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katow\u00e1) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\\n\\n\\nLanguage\\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\\n\\n\\nSub-tribes\\n\\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \\nLower",

HCN or CO2 have a much lower probability. SiO2 is pretty abundant, but not as distinct molecules.",

Besides being physically and emotionally relaxing, massage improves blood and lymph circulation, reduces nerve irritation and brings fresh oxygen and other nutrients to the affected tissues. Massage may also cause the body to produce fewer stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine (formerly adrenalin), and may also increase the body's production of pain-killing endorphins and the mood-altering hormone serotonin.\\n\\n  While seeing a professional massage therapist is relatively expensive, a friend or family member may be able to learn enough technique from a book or video to provide some relief for you.",

There are at least 3 types of beta receptors in the body - beta 1, 2, and 3 - and they are sensitive to epinephrine and norepinephrine. beta 1 controls heart rate and force of contraction in the heart (an increase in these will increase blood pressure, thus blocking them will lower blood pressure). beta 2 controls smooth muscle many places in the body. beta 3 receptors have less well defined role in fat metabolism.\\n\\nThe late American scientist Raymond Ahlqvist suggested already in 1948 that opposite effects of catecholamines were mediated by different receptors in the target organs, which he called alpha- and beta-receptors. http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1988/press.html",

  "what does fundamentalism mean?  Oftentimes, we mean \"An organized, militant Evangelical movement originating in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century in opposition to Protestant Liberalism and secularism, insisting on the inerrancy of Scripture.\" \\n\\nBut the concept of fundamentalism can be extended to any ideology or theology whose tenents include a strict adherance to a code, especially one which demands the observance by persons who do not subscribe to that code.\\n\\nNaturally, this makes for a source of conflict. And an understandable one at that. For example, say you believe some act is wrong. Furthermore, you believe you have a duty to prevent wrongdoing altogether. Consequently, you have a moral obligation to prevent any person from doing that act - including people who do not think that act is wrong.\\n\\nAny critical examination of a dogmatic theology or ideology will reveal how necessary this is, yet any objective look at disparate cultures will reveal how subjective - and frightening - this can be.\\n\\nThe hope of the future is that fundamentalist evangelism will be enacted by appeal to reason rather than dictates of law. Ideally, people would choose to perform 'right' acts for their own sake, rather than out of fear of punishment.",
  "Will the Texas Rangers ever entice good pitchers, given that their ballpark is hitter friendly?  Since the move to the Ballpark at Arlington, the Rangers have had pitchers selected to attend the All-Star game, which suggests it's not a question of pitchers' willingness to play there, but greater concerns about contracts or the future of the franchise.  Kenny Rogers, Jeff Zimmerman, Aaron Sele, Roger Pavlik, and John Wetteland were all excellent All-Star selections in spite of the \"hitter friendly\" park.  It's more about the team and management that keeps pitchers away, and less about the stadium.",
  "Whats the difference between gas operated and blowback operated Guns??  A gas-operated firearm operates on a similar principle of a car engine. When a round is fired, expanding gases propel the bullet out of the barrel, along with most of the gas. But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight.",

  "what is inferred reality and class inclusion?  Inferred reality is defined as the meaning of stimuli in the context of relevant information.\\n\\n\"Inclusion\" is a term used by educators to describe a philosophical approach to the education of children with disabilities. This philosophical paradigm maintains that a child with disabilities -- even severe disabilities such as profound mental retardation -- should be placed in a regular classroom for most or all of the school day (Ayres & Meyer, 1992; Cloud, 1992; Conn, 1992; Shanker, 1993; Wolak, York, & Corbin, 1992). Drawing from the legacy of the Civil Rights movement, advocates of full inclusion for children with disabilities state that \"Inclusion is the ultimate goal for all children with disabilities regardless of their disabilities or current placement\" (New York State Education Department, cited in Shanker, 1993). This is not without controversy. Among the most vocal opponents are those in the deaf community, who feel that their culture and language are at stake (Cohen, 1994) and the Learning Disabilities Association of America, which believes that mandatory full inclusion policies violate federal law (\"Full inclusion,\" undated).",

  "I want to become christian? I was raised with absolutely no religion, and have a hard time accepting christianity.  I want to beleive it.  What can I do? Over the past couple of years, I made many friends from China - most of whom are raised with no religion. And they're all great and wonderful individuals who don't seem to lack anything. I have had at times to explain certain things about the Christian religion to them, which is the dominant religion in the western world, and its practice can raise questions to the uninitiated.\\n\\nIf you seek spirituality, you should not limit your self to exploring one religion. Why do you dismiss Buddhism, Taoism etc? You should read about everything, speak to ministers and allow your self to form an opinion.\\n\\nMy advice is, to not let anyone convert you into something by sweet talking you, or promising the kingdom of God. Learn, and let it be your choice. If I were in your shoes, I would try to get all the facts and then decide on my own.\\n\\nMeet religious people and ask them how they practice religion and what it means to them. Your safest choice not to be tricked into a cult etc would be to go for a well established and long standing dogma or denomination.\\n\\nIn Christianity, since that is your question, the major two denominations are Catholic and Orthodox, which both came after a separation of the church between west (Catholic) and east (Orthodox). You can learn more on different religions by following the links below.\\n\\nI know in China most Christians are unitarian, since in 1949 the Government forced denominations to form one single church or leave China.\\n\\nRemember learn before you act, and don't let anyone influence you. My opinion is that once you decide on something you should stick by it. Should you make the conscious choice to have Faith in a religion. So being absolutely certain is essential. Changing religions in the manner you'd change shirts is not ideal. Because then Faith - which is the most important element in every religion - never gets too strong to mean anything in your life.\\n\\nWhatever choice you make - good luck to you!",

  "non POSIX-compatible C functions? what are POSIX non-compatible functions in C? You can think of POSIX as a runtime standard for C, but for many reasons, some language/operating system providers decide to either not provide a determined function, change its parameters, its name or some criterion on how to handle the request.\\nIf a certain operating system does support the full set of POSIX operations with the standard names, parameters and criteria, then they may certify that with IEEE.\\nThat allows you to create a C program and, as long as you use only POSIX functions, it's bound to work correctly on any POSIX-conformant system.\\n\\nHope it helped!

  "Can the electorial college override the majority of the vote? if so, why?  Yes.  It is possible for the winner of an election to get as little as 39% of the vote, and carry the electoral college.  This happens when the winner wins by only a handful of votes in states he or she wins, and losing completely in all other states.\\nThis is caused by the lack of proportional voting in states.  A states electoral votes, with exceptions of Maine and Nebraska, either go all to one candidate or the other.  If half the state votes one way, and half the other, the smaller half is effectively not counted.  With proportional voting, or district-level voting, this remains true, but it can only affect one vote per state, and is as likely to fall one way as the other.\\nI hope this answered your question.",

  "how is the RIAA catching individuals downloading pirated music? How are they getting these people they are suing?  Are they tracking IPs, are they watching torrents, P2P, how are they doing it? The short answer is, yes, of course they are tracking IPs.  The long answer to your other question follows.\\n\\nIt is a straight-forward, multistep process.\\n\\n1. Encourage laws that require internet service and server providers to log IP addresses (9/11 pretty much nailed that one for them).\\n2. Collect proof of misdeeds for each particular P2P service that is allowing illegal file copying.\\n3. Sue the P2P service and demand they hand over IP addresses of offending users.\\n4. Trace IP addresses back to users.  Remember, the businesses involved all have to keep records.\\n\\nAlso, some programs embed identifying information in them.\\n\\nPretty much any Microsoft program, at least one that uses OLE Structured Storage, creates these huge ID numbers in them called a GUID for each item in the file.  Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\\n\\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. It may not be enough to find who did it but it is probably helpful in proving a given computer did it once they have that computer.\\n\\nThere is probably more going on but you get the idea. At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\\n\\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. And, just as important, more evidence is accumulating which is used in court as proof of a crime being committed and intent to commit a crime on the part of the peope being sued by the RIAA - or whoever.\\n\\nSo, either listen to: music you buy, public domain music, music from the radio - or compose/play your own.\\n\\nYou probably don't like it when you found out someone copied off your test at school.  It makes them get a higher grade than they deserve and if the test is graded on a curve, your A- work can wind up being counted as a B+.  \\n\\nWell, songwriters composed that music and/or lyrics, musicians practiced and learned to play that song and paid to use a recording studio to perform it in.  When people don't pay to hear that play, the musicians still have their expenses to pay but no royalty check to pay for it. They lose money doing what they love.\\n\\nEven if someone cannot afford a whole album they can still afford to buy their favorite song for 99 cents.",
  "Does a root canal treatment pose a potential health threat? I've heard conflicting opinions. What is your personal experience? I had a root canal two years ago, and practically drove myself insane worrying about the potential health impact of it down the road.  Other than the first few days, I've never had any significant pain or discomfort.  I've come to the realization that since I'm only in my early 30's, I'd rather take the risk with a root canal and keep my tooth, rather than have it yanked and either be toothless or pay a lot of money for other options that would still involve putting foreign substances in my mouth.  So, I guess my recommendation regarding root canals would be that if you are a healthy person, with a good immune system, a root canal would probably be a good option, rather than losing your tooth.  But, I do believe they could impact your health, and the decision should be an informed one.",

The puzzle was first published in New York by the specialist puzzle publisher Dell Magazines in its magazine Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games, under the title Number Place (which we can only assume Garns named it).\\n\\nIt was popularized by Nikoli in Japan, who gave it the current name of \"Sudoku.",

  "What is RSS?  \"RSS\" stands for Really Simple Syndication, Rich Site Summary, and/or Rockdale, Sandow, and Southern (Railroad) (if you trust the good folks at AcronymFinder.com). Really Simple Syndication is probably the most widely agreed-upon choice. As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. Using this standard, Web publishers provide updates, such as the latest news headlines or weblog postings. Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a \"feed\").\\n\\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. There are many desktop applications for Windows and Mac OS system users, but two of our favorites are FeedDemon (Windows) and NetNewsWire (Mac OS X). Both require a small purchase price but are tops for ease of use and ship with dozens of feeds pre-loaded so you can explore the syndication \"universe\" right away. Free readers are available as well; a search for \"RSS Reader\" at popular search sites will yield many results.\\n\\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). Also, any upgrades or new features are added automatically. The trade-off comes in different (some would say fewer) features and slightly slower performance versus desktop systems. NewsGator, Bloglines, and new RSS content capabilities in My Yahoo! are probably the three best-known examples of web-based feed reading services.",

He's a white thin-skinned 83-yr-old man who's skin is now sensitive to sun, heat, light, TV, etc., so it even hurts to lay on the sheets in the bed. He gets cancer eruptions burnt off as they flair up but wants relief from continual ouchiness. He cant even wear his sun hat nor sun glasses anymore 'cause it hurts wherever they touch his skin. He tries to get his mind off of problems but he cant do anything without being irritated. (He already tried noxzema, uses zinc oxide, tries various skin products & soaps ...)  Any answers?? Thanks! Please listen to me as I am only here to help. You have to do exactly as I say. Go to the website and look up CESIUM CHLORIDE AND OXYGEN DROPS. The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.  So, if you do exactly what I say, not only will you have a chance to survive, but all your friends that may get cancer...",

  "'Intelligent Design' should be better named 'Malevolent Design'. Do you agree ?  Intelligent design embodies a theology that features a god who is malicious toward people.  \\n\\n1.  When you look below the surface, the world is filled with evidence that leads open minded people to conclude that evolution has occurred.  This evidence comes from the fields of paleontology, paleogeography, biogeography, molecular biology, genetics, embryology, and probably lots of others.  The god of intelligent design would have had to rig this evidence in favor of misleading us.\\n\\n2.  If the god of intelligent design violates the natural laws he created to create living organisms and to create false evidence, how often does he do this?  For example, maybe two seconds ago, he created the us and the entire universe, including this message up to this point, my memory of having written it, and your memory of having read it thus far.  If god violates natural law, anything is possible.\\n\\n3.  If the intelligent design god is going to create the world in any whimsical way, then he created all the suffering that we endure when he could have created a world without suffering.  Either he willfuly created our suffering, or he is an inept creator.\\n\\n4.  If the existence of complex organisms proves the existence of an intelligent designer, then the existence of the intelligent designer proves the existence of a more intelligent designer who created him.  ...and an even more intelligent designer who created the second one.   ...and an even more than more intelligent designer who created the thrid one.  ...and so on, ad infinitum.

  "What is Linux? Okay, I'm pretty sure linux is an operating system, but whats the deal about it? I mean i've heard that joke about, \"use the best. apples for graphics, linux for servers and windows for solitaire\". I understand the joke but what is linux, who really uses it? Linux Pronounced lee-nucks or lih-nucks. A freely-distributable open source operating system that runs on a number of hardware platforms. The Linux kernel was developed mainly by Linus Torvalds. Because it's free, and because it runs on many platforms, including PCs and Macintoshes, Linux has become an extremely popular alternative to proprietary operating systems.\\n\\nLinux is a computer operating system and its kernel. It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\\n\\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. Most broadly, a Linux distribution bundles large quantities of application software with the core system, and provides more user-friendly installation and upgrades.\\n\\nInitially, Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. Since then, Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market. Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\\n\\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). It is deployed in applications ranging from embedded systems (such as mobile phones and personal video recorders) to personal computers to supercomputers.\\n\\n\\nTo know much more about linux Read the very good article\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINUX",

  "Were there any Marines that saw service in the European theater during WW II? Were they exclusive to the Pacific and the war against Japan? Shortly after the United States entered World War II, the Allies agreed that the European Theater would have priority in the war over the Pacific Theater. The Marine Corps' war was in the Pacific and all war plans regarding the employment of Marines reflected that. Nevertheless, because the Marine Corps was part of the naval establishment, it had responsibility also for furnishing men to parts of the Navy assigned to the European and Mediterranean theaters and to the operations conducted there.\\n\\nThese were not large Marine formations, but were, for the most part, individual Marines and small detachments assigned to guard duty at the barracks and naval operating bases established in the United Kingdom, or men assigned as \"sea-going\" Marines in the detachments of the large fighting ships. Another category was filled by those intrepid Marines who volunteered for duty with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), to undertake covert operations with the underground against the Nazis in the occupied countries of Europe and North Africa.",
  "why the movie brokeback mountain, hasn't been shown in all movie theaters?  Cowboys have become an American icon, the very essence of manhood.

  "what is the pre-n router?  Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. The trade-off made is convenience for speed. Today\u2019s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. Their work has yet to be completed. The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\\n\\n\\nStandards\\n\\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. This would ensure compatibility.\\n\\n\\nImplications\\n\\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\\n\\n\\nImplementation\\n\\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. The setup would most likely begin with a router. This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. These allow any wired device to be included on the network. The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\\n\\n\\nAdvantages/Conclusions\\n\\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. Data is still being broadcast over radio frequencies. Before deciding whether to use Pre-N technology, one must first decide whether wireless is appropriate for their application. Only then should 802.11n be considered.",

  "Is DNA the real map from where we come from and where we go to????  Interestingly phrased.\\n\\nYes, I would say that DNA is the map from where we are coming from. Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\\n\\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. It is contained in our mitochandria. Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key \"markers\" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\\n\\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. Let me give you an example. Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. Others will not be so lucky. If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are.",

  "Why do girls try to have sex with you then expect you to want a relaitonship or feel its the next step.? I keep noticing that girls will make the first move or try to get in your bed.

Furthermore, when there are no signs of anything changing why act surprised or angered? Alot of females lack an amount of respect for themselves. So they deem the amount of sex or the intensity of the act as a means of actually being with someone. Rather than establishing the relationship first and allowing the loving to be the icing on the cake. It's kind of like when we were kids and played make believe. However,the difference would be that we adventually snapped back to reality.

  "Who is nicolaus copernicus?  \"Miko\u0142aj Kopernik (February 19, 1473\u2013May 24, 1543), more commonly known by the Latin form Nicolaus Copernicus, was a Polish astronomer, mathematician and economist, mainly remembered for developing a scientifically useful heliocentric (Sun-centered) theory of the solar system. His main occupations and services rendered were in Royal Prussia, as church canon, governor and administrator, economist, jurist, physician, astrologer and military leader (conducting defense against the Teutonic Order). Amid all his responsibilities, he treated astronomy as a hobby. His theory about the Sun as the center of the Universe, opposed to the traditional geocentric theory that placed Earth at the center, is considered one of the most important discoveries ever, and is the fundamental starting point of modern astronomy and modern science itself (it inaugurated a scientific revolution). His theory affected many aspects of human life, opening the door for young astronomers, scientists and scholars to take a skeptical attitude toward established dogma.\"",

  "if my credit is bad how do i get a loan to get on the right track and pay all my debts?  If you have past due accounts with collection agencies your best bet is to try and settle the debt with them for a portion of what you owe.

Most hospitals and doctors offices will not send your account to collections if you are still making small payments each month.  If you owe a credit card company they usually agree to drop interest charges or late payments in return for a lump sum payment to pay off your account.  If you still want a loan to pay your debts you should consider a secured loan from a bank or credit union.  They use your house or automobile as collateral until you pay off the loan.

Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\\n\\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\\n\\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. Without it, they would just be average.\\n\\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\\n\\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it.

  "Does cancelling store credit cards help or hurt your credit score?  It may actually hurt you FICO score.\\n\\nOne part of the score is the amount of credit used versus the amount of credit available. So, let's take a look at an example:\\n\\n$200 total credit available\\n$175 total credit used\\n Ratio of 0.875 (high)\\n\\n$5000 total credit available\\n$1000 total credit used\\n Ration of 0.2 (relatively low)\\n\\nThe bottom ration of 0.2 is more ideal. Credit companies have found that the higher the ratio a person has (they get credit and max it out), the less likely they will pay it off.\\n\\nOf course some store credit cards do not report to the credit bureaua unless you go to collections. So it doesn\u2019t matter what you do with them as long as you don\u2019t stop paying them.\\n\\nIt\u2019s best to just hold on to them. You might even consider having the credit limit taken up (but don\u2019t max them out). It\u2019s not how much of a limit you have that\u2019s important to the credit companies, it how much of it you\u2019re using.\\n\\nAlso you may want to consider the fact that although your credit score may not be affected very much if you cancel your card, if the store reports to the credit bureau, other companies will see that you canceled a card. To other companies, this means if they give you credit, you\u2019re likely to just cancel it. Meaning you may be more of a hassle than you\u2019re worth.\\n\\nHope this helps.",

  "what kind of things did people do to get motivated to lose weight im having a hard time?  Motivation is a hard thing. I've lost right at 150 lbs. & I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :)\\n\\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity...don't know why. Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\\n\\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of \"bad nasties\". I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store...Victoria's Secret, to be exact. My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. But it just hit me oddly. I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\\n\\nThat's what did it...that's what started the whole process. By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. So, here's how I handled it...\\n\\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want...I'm not kidding. True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating but I also don't beat myself up about it. If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. The big problem for me was breads.\\n\\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\\n\\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes where you can.\\n\\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages...OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! But you know what? I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! That's motivation, I can promise you...\\n\\nMy suggestion after all",

First, it'd be easier to learn compared to Arabic, Chinese or Slavic languages since the LAtin alphabet is used.  Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language).  Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. Plus you probably already have an affinity with the sounds and the intonation of that language.\\nLearning new languages is fun and eventually useful, and it is a wonderful exercise for your brain.

  "My ex and I \"date\" but haven't been official in 9 years. How do I tell him that I still luv him and want more?

  "What is ottoman empire?  Ottoman Empire also Turkish Empire\\n\\nA vast Turkish sultanate of southwest Asia, northeast Africa, and southeast Europe. It was founded in the 13th century by Osman I and ruled by his descendants until its dissolution after World War I. Originally a small state controlled by Ottoman or Osmanli Turks, it spread rapidly, superseding the Byzantine Empire in the east.\\n\\n\\nOttoman Empire (\u014ft'\u0259m\u0259n) , vast state founded in the late 13th cent. by Turkish tribes in Anatolia and ruled by the descendants of Osman I until its dissolution in 1918. Modern Turkey formed only part of the empire, but the terms \u201cTurkey\u201d and \u201cOttoman Empire\u201d were often used interchangeably.\\nOrganization of the Empire\\n\\nEconomically, socially, and militarily, Turkey was a medieval state, unaffected by the developments in the rest of Europe. Turkish domination over the northern part of Africa (except Tripoli and Egypt) was never well defined or effective, and the eastern border was inconstant, shifting according to frequent wars with Persia. Of the vassal princes, only the khans of Crimea were generally loyal.\\n\\nThe sultans themselves had sunk into indolence and depravity. Until the ascension (1603) of Ahmad I, the succession to the throne was habitually contested by all the sons of the deceased sultan, and it was the patriotic duty of the victor to kill his rivals in order to restore order. Although this practice was barbarous, when it ceased other problems arose. The eldest male member of the family was recognized as the heir-designate, but to prevent threats to the sultan the imperial prince was denied any involvement in public affairs and was kept in luxurious imprisonment. When the prince finally ascended the throne, he was often alcoholic or lunatic.\\n\\nActual rule was usually exercised by the grand viziers, many of whom were able men (notably those of the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family). The sultans themselves often were the creatures of the Janissaries, whose favor was purchased by large gifts at the ascension of a sultan.\\n\\nOne of the most nefarious aspects of the court of Constantinople (known as the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte) was the all-pervading corruption and bribery that had been raised to a system of administration. The pashas and hospodars (governors) who administered the provinces and vassal states purchased their posts at exorbitant prices. They recovered their fortunes by extorting still larger sums from their subjects. The peasantry was thus reduced to abject misery.\\n\\nA positive feature in Ottoman administration was the religious toleration generally extended to all non-Muslims. This, however, did not prevent occasional massacres and discriminatory fiscal practices. In Constantinople the Greeks and Armenians held a privileged status and were very influential in commerce and politics. The despotic system of government was mitigated only by the observance of Muslim law.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nOrigins\\n\\nThe Ottoman state began as one of many small Turkish states that emerged in Asia Minor during the breakdown of the empire of the Seljuk Turks. The Ottoman Turks began to absorb the other states, and during the reign (1451\u201381) of Muhammad II they ended all other local Turkish dynasties. The early phase of Ottoman expansion took place under Osman I, Orkhan, Murad I, and Beyazid I at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, and Serbia. Bursa fell in 1326 and Adrianople (the modern Edirne) in 1361; each in turn became the capital of the empire. The great Ottoman victories of Kosovo (1389) and Nikopol (1396) placed large parts of the Balkan Peninsula under Ottoman rule and awakened Europe to the Ottoman danger. The Ottoman siege of Constantinople was lifted at the appearance of Timur, who defeated and captured Beyazid in 1402. The Ottomans, however, soon rallied.\\n\\nThe Period of Great Expansion\\n\\nThe empire, reunited by Muhammad I, expanded victoriously under Muhammad's successors Murad II and Muhammad II. The victory (1444) at Var",

  "What's the rate of heat loss through a domestic well-insulated wall per sqm when the heat differential is 15C?  There are such values, called R-values.  They define the resistance to heat loss per unit time, temperature difference and area (i.e., higher is better).  These are English units, hour-degreeF-ft^2/BTU.  An R-value of 20 means that 100 sq. ft. of wall separating a 20 deg F temperature difference for 8 hours passes 800 BTU of heat.  Typical recommended R-values (ref. 1) for use in residences are 4 to 60, depending on climate and location in the house.  For walls the range is 11 to 28.  In the ref. 2 web site you can find R ratings for various insulation materials, in R-value per inch of insulation thickness, and thicknesses required for various recommended R-values.",

Compare this situation with Ionic bond where electrns get completely transferred & the atoms get ionized (charged).

  "are masons satanic?  This is a true question of semantics and religion.  Some would say that first of all, freemasonry has no connection to religion, so there is no way to say that masons are satanic.  Others might say that freemasons are inherently religious people with connections to their status in the society directly coorelating with their positions in their church of choice.  Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called \"faith\" and the controlling of culture through that so-called \"faith\"...thereby falling into suspicion of \"satanic\" influences.  It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\\n\\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.  Furthermore, any member of a masonic society will claim no knowledge of satanic connections to their brotherhood.  The secrets of these societies are replete with whispers of foul play and undertones of godless or godlike actions and/or beliefs.  \\n\\nYour answer lies in your question.

  "what is the difference between DVD+R and DVD-R ?  DVD-R (pronounced \"DVD dash R\") and DVD+R (pronounced \"DVD plus R\") are nearly identical formats. The discs look the same and are both supported by most DVD-ROM drives and DVD burners. The only difference between the formats is the way they determine the location of the laser beam on the disc. DVD-R discs use tiny marks along the grooves in the discs, called land prepits, to determine the laser position. DVD+R discs do not have land prepits, but instead measure the \"wobble frequency\" as the laser moves toward the outside of the disc.\\n\\nThe DVD-R format was developed by Pioneer and was released in the second half of 1997. DVD+R was developed by Sony and Philips and was introduced in 2002. Companies that support DVD-R include Pioneer, Toshiba, Hitachi, and Panasonic, while companies that support DVD+R include Sony, Philips, Hewlett-Packard, Ricoh, and Yamaha.\\n\\nHowever, most of these companies now develop hybrid DVD drives that support both DVD-R and DVD+R formats. They are known as DVD\u00b1R or DVD\u00b1RW drives. When looking for media for your DVD drive, make sure it ends in \"-R\" if you have a DVD-R drive or \"+R\" if you have a DVD+R drive. If you have a DVD\u00b1R drive, you can use either format. DVD-R is still more popular than DVD+R, but since they are both widely supported, it should not matter which format you choose.",
  "Is it worth doing Masters from University of Southern California? I started off with my Masters program in Electrical Engineering in University of Arizona, Tucson where I did four graduate level courses. Later I shifted to California State University at Los Angeles (CSULA) and did two graduate level courses in Electrical Engineering program. Now I received admission into Masters in Electrical Engineering in University of Southern California (USC) for Spring 2005. But I have found that USC would transfer only 4 units and that I would have to mostly do all the 27 units required for the Masters program in USC. That would cost me 27x1100 approx = 30,000 approx USD. Is it really worth graduating from University of Southern California spending that much money? Can I get the same job graduating from CSULA as I would get graduating from USC? As someone in the technology field in the Los Angeles area, I would have to say that the USC degree is worth more than one from CSULA, because of the quality of the professors and program. USC's EE program is much higher rated that any CS school--in fact it's ranked among MIT, Stanford, Caltech, CMU, and others as one of the top schools in the nation according to the U.S. News and World Report. (That said, I got my own degree there...) The rankings were 1. MIT 2. Stanford 3. Berkeley 4. Georgia Tech / U of Illinois Urbana 6. Univ. of Michigan 7. USC Viterbi School 8. Caltech 9.

For instance, if your anxiety is preventing you from leaving the house, you could be missing out on excersize.

It can be crippling, and nobody should have to live like that. \\n\\nFor a quick fix, Xanax or a Benzo drug is effective, but not good for long term use. Zoloft is excellent, and non-addictive.

  "what is a quantum leap?  a quantum leap is when an electron gets excited, moving it to the next energy level, and then falls back down.  This falling back down produces energy in the form of light. (this is the reason neon lights and similar lights light up, the electrons get excited by the electricity, and the process of them falling down produces energy in the form of light. The color is determined by which energy level it is falling from and into, and usually remains consistent for each element.) Well anyway, the electron jumping from one energy level to the next is called a 'quantum leap'",

  "Is it really all that difficult for a female to be elected US president? With Geena Davis acting recently in Commander-in-Chief and almost no fiction (excepting maybe When Spirits Beckon at Amazon.com), it's surprising that there's very little discussion on the prospects of either Condi Rice or Hillary Clinton becoming the 1st female president. Even if the right supports Condi in the Presidential Cabinet, I really doubt their support would run all of the way to the Presidency. There are far to many in the \"religion right\" that would have a ideological problem with a woman being President. \\n\\nAs for Hillary, I think she could get a lot of support from the more liberal left, but still not enough to be elected.

  "what is a transistor laser?  A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a \"pure\" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned.  This differs from light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are somewhat simpler solid-state devices that emit a range of wavelengths and do so in many directions at once.  Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\\n\\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance.  That's why lasers are used in optical networking (especially telephony and long-haul Internet backbones) and also why it's dangerous to stare at one (the light energy is transferred to your retina so efficiently that it can destroy the cells).",

  "How many dimensions are we really able to perceive? Some scientists talk about our \u201c4 dimensions\u201d in space and time, but only studied people in that field have some idea of what that means. If you ask a 15-year-old, in a simple answer he/she will say: \u201cthree\u201d. Are there more dimensions beyond our understanding? Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three.\\n\\nTime is often referred to as the \"fourth dimension\". It is, in essence, one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that movement seems to occur at a fixed rate and in one direction. The equations used by physics to model reality often do not treat time in the same way that humans perceive it.\\n\\nTheories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size.",

They don't understand that, if a man really loves a woman, he doesn't intentionally hurt her...whether physically or emotionally.\\n\\nGood luck & keep trying! You'll find a good guy.
