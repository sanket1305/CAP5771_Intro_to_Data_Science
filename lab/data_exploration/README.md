# Data Exploration Lab

In this lab, we accomplished the following tasks:

1. **Developed Code to Retrieve Weather Data**  
   - Implemented functionality to fetch weather data from two different URLs for a specific location.

2. **Enhanced Code with a Reusable Function**  
   - Introduced a function, `fetchdata(url, isjson)`, to streamline data fetching. This function eliminates the need to rewrite code for each request by handling both JSON and non-JSON responses efficiently.
